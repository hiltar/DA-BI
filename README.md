This idea of this teamwork is to implement a linear multivariate regression or a decision tree analysis with one or some of the Python’s data analysis and manipulation libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. 
The team must have 3 to 4 members.
The subject and aim of your analysis must be accepted by the instructor before the group can start working on it. You can do this by email.
The evaluation of the teamwork will happen by re-performing the analysis and evaluating the results in the presence of the instructor. Please, write also a common report that documents the aim of your project, describes the dataset, documents your data analysis process, and evaluates the results.  The efforts of the individual team members will also be evaluated in the event.
Please, book a time for evaluation event for a week starting on Mon 20 April 2020. The 15 minutes long time slots will be published later in Optima.
Return the report into the Optima return box no later than Sun 19 April 2020 at 16.00.


The tasks and the evaluation:


1.	Decide what you are going to do: 1) Predict or forecast a value of a numerical value or 2) classify data to two or more categorical classes.


2.	Get a data set that you can use for prediction or classification. You can select one of the datasets available on the Net. You can also use data that is your own.


3.	Document the subject and aim of your data analysis project. (0,0 or 0, 25)


4.	Select one regression analysis or one decision tree tutorial from the Net. It must be one that utilizes at least one of the Python’s data analysis or data manipulation libraries.


5.	Program the tutorial and evaluate the results. (0,0 or 0, 5)


6.	Describe and prepare the dataset you selected for analysis. (0,0 or 0,25)


7.	Perform the analyses with your own data. (0,0, 0,25 or 0,50)


8.	Evaluate the results of your analyses. (0,0 or 0,25)


9.	Write a report that documents the aim of your project, describes the dataset, documents your data analysis process, and evaluates the results. (0,25)
 


Extra. If you get at least 0,5 points from the task 1 to 9, the you can earn 0,5 points extra by comparing doing data analysis with Python’s data analyzes and data manipulation libraries with doing it from the scratch. Document the results. (0,0, 0,25, or 0,5)
Please note that you can also suggest another subject for your teamwork to the instructor as long as it related to data analyses or data visualization.
